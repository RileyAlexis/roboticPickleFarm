# Robotic Pickle Farm

"Make pickles, take over the world..."

Robotic Pickle Farm is an incremental/clicker 
game created by Riley Alexis as her first web dev project. 
The game is in the spirit of Universal Paperclips, A Dark Room or 
Kittens Game. It involves an iterative game style where a player's 
goal is to make as many pickles as possible. 
The eventual goal is to produce 2.8 trillion pickles, roughly 
equal to the annual global output of planet Earth.

## Release

This game is currently in the very early stages of development.

### Technology Stack

 Robotic Pickle Farm is created using React, Redux, Redux-Saga, 
Node, Express and Postgres. User sessions handled by JSON Web 
Token and Bcrypt.
